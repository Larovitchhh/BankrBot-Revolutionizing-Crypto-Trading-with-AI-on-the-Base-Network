Base Network, developed by Coinbase, is an optimistic rollup L2 built on Ethereum. It addresses Ethereum's scalability issues by bundling transactions off-chain and settling them on the mainnet, resulting in fees as low as pennies and speeds rivaling centralized exchanges. Key highlights include:Ecosystem Growth: Home to protocols like Morpho (lending with $1.5B TVL) and a thriving meme coin scene.
Developer-Friendly: Relentless support for builders, including grants from the Base Ecosystem Fund.
Recent Milestones: Despite a brief 29-minute outage in August 2025 due to a sequencer issue—the first since launch—Base has maintained near-perfect uptime, underscoring its reliability.

Base's ethos of "empowering without extracting" resonates with projects like BankrBot, fostering an environment where AI agents can thrive without prohibitive costs.
