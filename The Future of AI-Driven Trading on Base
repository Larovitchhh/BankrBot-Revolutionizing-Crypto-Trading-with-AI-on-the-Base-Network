BankrBot's trajectory points to a broader vision: AI agents as the default interface for crypto. Upcoming features include third-party wallet integrations, enhanced automations, and expanded chain support (voted on by $BNKR holders). With Base exploring its own network token, synergies could amplifyâ€”imagine $BNKR rewards tied to Base governance.Challenges remain, like Base's occasional sequencer centralization risks, but BankrBot's multi-chain flexibility mitigates them. As social platforms evolve, BankrBot positions Base as the go-to L2 for agentic finance, blending memes, trading, and community in one seamless loop.
